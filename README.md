This is a game, its version 0.0.4, I'm a novice developer, so don't judge too hard.

Additional libraries are not required, on which versions it does not work.
Innovations:
- Text interface
- Bugs fixed
- Added the purchase of assets, only one company, but this is just an attempt.
- Added cheat codes for testing.
- Created one game activity - mining.
- Initially, there is no localization, unless English option.
- Pending additions Settings and Continue game.
- Tested a lot of functions, but still there are problems that I can not solve.
- It is desirable to solve the problem with animation and it is possible to connect other libraries for better work.
- Problems left to solve str and int.
